Enable caching of the WordPress REST API and auto-flush caches upon wp-admin editing.

== Description ==
Are you using the WordPress REST API and are you experiencing it to be slow? This plugin will allow WordPress to cache the results of the REST API, making it much faster.

This plugin offers:

* Caching of all default WordPress REST API `GET`-endpoints.
* Caching of (custom) post type endpoints.
* Caching of (custom) taxonomy endpoints.
* Automated flushing of caches if (some of) its contents are edited.
* Manual flushing of all caches.
* Manual flushing of specific caches.
* Statistics about how many times a cache has been retrieved.
* Specifying after what time the cache should be timed out.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have edited a page/post, do I need to clear the cache? =

No, the plugin will automatically flush all cache related to the page/post you just edited.

= I have created a custom post type, will the plugin cache the custom post type endpoint? =

Yes, the plugin will automatically cache the endpoint of custom post types.

= I have created a custom taxonomy, will the plugin cache the taxonomy endpoint? =

Yes, the plugin will automatically cache the endpoint of custom taxonomies.

= I have created a custom WP REST endpoint, will the plugin cache this endpoint? =

No, the plugin will not cache your custom endpoint unless you tell it to cache it using the hook `wp_rest_cache/allowed_endpoints`. Please keep in mind that once you do so the plugin will not automatically flush the cache of that endpoint if something is edited (it has no way of knowing when to flush the cache).
